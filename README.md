# Milestone Project 4 - Gamernetic
## Purpose

This website was created to complete the fourth Milestone Project for Code Insitute's Full Stack Software Developer course. I built this from the ground up using knowledge I gained from the previous modules. The objective of this project is to showcase my ability to create a true Full Stack application using the Django framework. The full list of technologies used can be found in the technologies section further down.

Users of this website are able to create, read, update and delete posts regarding any subject in the gaming industry.

You can find the link to the live website right [here](https://gamernetic.herokuapp.com/).
